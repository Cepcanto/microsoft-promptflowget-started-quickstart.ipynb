**Prompt flow** is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

With prompt flow, you will be able to:

- **Create and Iteratively Develop Flow**
    - Create executable workflows that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other tools together.
    - Debug and iterate your flows, especially the interaction with LLMs with ease.
- **Evaluate Flow Quality and Performance**
    - Evaluate your flow's quality and performance with larger datasets.
    - Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.
    - Deploy your flow to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your app's code base easily.
- (Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of [Prompt flow in Azure AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow?view=azureml-api-2).

### Concept Overview

![concept](examples/tutorials/quick-start/media/concept.png)
Learn more about the concept of Prompt flow [here](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/concepts/index.html).

## Get Started with Prompt flow ‚ö°

### Install
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A python environment, `python=3.9` is recommended.

```sh
pip install promptflow promptflow-tools
```

(Optional) Install <img src="examples/tutorials/quick-start/media/logo_pf.png" alt="alt text" width="25"/>**Prompt flow VS Code extension** from [visualstudio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-flow.prompt-flow).

### Set Up Connection for Your OpenAI API Key

Let's start by preparing a dedicated folder for this quick start and a yaml file `connection.yaml` to define the connection:

```sh
mkdir pf-test
cd pf-test
touch connection.yaml
```
Open the `connection.yaml` file. Paste the following connection configuration into the file, name this connection as `open_ai_connection`, and replace `<your_openai_key>` with your OpenAI API key:

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/promptflow/latest/OpenAIConnection.schema.json
name: open_ai_connection
type: open_ai
api_key: <your_openai_key>
```

To finalize the connection setup, run the following CLI command:

```sh
pf connection create -f connection.yaml
```
### Initialize a Prompt Flow Using the Chat Template

Use the following CLI command to initiate a prompt flow from a chat template. This action will create a new flow folder called "my_chatbot":

```sh
pf flow init --flow my_chatbot --type chat
```
### Chat with Your Flow
 
You can interact with your flow using the following command. Enter your question in the `User` section. Press `Ctrl + C` to end the session:

```sh
pf flow test --flow my_chatbot --interactive
```

### Value in Evaluation and Quality Improvement üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

LLMs' randomness can yield unstable answers. Fine-tuning prompts can improve output reliability. Testing with larger datasets and comparing outputs to the ground truth is crucial for accurate quality assessment.
