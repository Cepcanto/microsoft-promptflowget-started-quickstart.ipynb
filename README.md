**Prompt flow** is a suite of development tools designed to streamline the end-to-end development cycle of LLM-based AI applications, from ideation, prototyping, testing, evaluation to production deployment and monitoring. It makes prompt engineering much easier and enables you to build LLM apps with production quality.

With prompt flow, you will be able to:

- **Create and Iteratively Develop Flow**
    - Create executable workflows that link LLMs, prompts, Python code and other tools together.
    - Debug and iterate your flows, especially the interaction with LLMs with ease.
- **Evaluate Flow Quality and Performance**
    - Evaluate your flow's quality and performance with larger datasets.
    - Integrate the testing and evaluation into your CI/CD system to ensure quality of your flow.
    - Deploy your flow to the serving platform you choose or integrate into your app's code base easily.
- (Optional but highly recommended) Collaborate with your team by leveraging the cloud version of [Prompt flow in Azure AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow?view=azureml-api-2).

### Concept Overview

![concept](examples/tutorials/quick-start/media/concept.png)
Learn more about the concept of Prompt flow [here](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/concepts/index.html).

------
## Get Started with Prompt flow ‚ö°

### Installation

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A python environment, `python=3.9` is recommended.

```sh
pip install promptflow promptflow-tools
```

### Set Up Connection for Your API Key

Create a yaml file `connection.yaml` to define the connection.
<details>
<summary> <b>connection.yaml</b> (click to toggle the yaml content)</summary>

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/promptflow/latest/OpenAIConnection.schema.json
name: open_ai_connection # name of the connection
type: open_ai
api_key: <your_openai_key> # replace with your OpenAI API key
```
</details>

Run the following CLI command to create the connection:

```sh
pf connection create -f connection.yaml
```
More details about connection can be found [here](https://microsoft.github.io/concepts/concept-connections.html).

### Quick Start from a Template

<details>
<summary><b>Initialize a prompt flow using the chat template.</b> (click to toggle the detailed introduction of the command)</summary>

Use the following CLI command to initiate a prompt flow from a chat template. This will create a new **flow folder** named "my_chatbot" and initiate flow files within it:

> The `--flow` argument is used to specify the path to the flow folder.

</details>

```sh
pf flow init --flow ./my_chatbot --type chat
```

<details>
<summary><b>Chat with your flow</b> (click to toggle the detailed introduction of the command)</summary>
 
You can interact with your flow using the following command. Enter your question in the `User` section. Press `Ctrl + C` to end the session.

</details>

```sh
pf flow test --flow ./my_chatbot --interactive
```

**What's Next? Ensuring ‚ÄùHigh Quality‚Äú with Prompt Flow**

Before deploying your application to production, it is crucial to evaluate its quality.

<details>
<summary><b> Why is quality evaluation so important?</b></summary>

LLMs' randomness can yield unstable answers. Fine-tuning prompts can improve output reliability.  For accurate quality assessment, it's essential to test with larger datasets and compare outcomes with the ground truth.

During fine-tuning the prompt, we also consider to strike a balance between the accuracy and the token cost of the LLM.

Invest just 15 minutes to understand how prompt flow accelerates prompt tuning, testing, and evaluation, to find an ideal prompt **(accuracy ‚Üë,token ‚Üì)**

## Tutorial üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Prompt Flow is a tool designed to **facilitate high quality LLM-native apps to production**, the development process in prompt flow follows these steps: Develop a flowÔºå improve the flow quality, deploy the flow to production.

### Develop your own LLM apps

Begin with our comprehensive [Step-by-Step Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/quick-start.html): This is a detailed walkthrough step-by-step to create your own flow from scratch and invoke your first flow run.

#### VS Code Extension

In addition to the SDK, we offer a <img src="examples/tutorials/quick-start/media/logo_pf.png" alt="alt text" width="25"/>**Prompt flow VS Code extension** for an interactive and user-friendly flow development experience. Install it from [visualstudio marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-flow.prompt-flow).
