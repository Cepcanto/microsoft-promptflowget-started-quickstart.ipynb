# Adding category and tags for tool

This document is dedicated to guiding you through the process of categorizing and tagging your tools for optimal organization and efficiency. Categories help you organize your tools into specific folders, making it much easier to find what you need. Tags, on the other hand, work like labels that offer more detailed descriptions. They enable you to quickly search and filter tools based on specific characteristics or functions. By using categories and tags, you'll not only tailor your tool library to your preferences but also save time by effortlessly finding the right tool for any task.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| category  | str  | No       | Organizes tools into folders by common features. |
| tags      | dict | No       | Offers detailed, searchable descriptions of tools through key-value pairs. |

**Important Notes:**
- Tools without an assigned category will be listed in the root folder.
- Tools lacking tags will display an empty tags field.

## Prerequisites
- Please ensure that your [Prompt flow for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-flow.prompt-flow) is updated to version 1.1.0 or later.
- Please install promptflow package and ensure that its version is 1.1.0 or later.

## How to add category and tags for a tool

You can use [pf tool init](../../reference/pf-command-reference.md#pf-tool-init) to initialize a package tool with category and tags:
```python
pf tool init --package <package-name> --tool <tool-name> --set category=<tool_category> tags=<tool_tags>

```

Here, we use an example to show the categories and tags of the tool after initialization. Assume that the user executes this command:
```python
pf tool init --tool my_tool --set name="My First Tool" description="This is my first tool"  category="test_tool" tags="{'tag1':'value1','tag2':'value2'}"
```
The generated tool script is as follows, where category and tags have been configured on the tool:
```python
from promptflow import tool
from promptflow.connections import CustomConnection


@tool(
    name="My First Tool",
    description="This is my first tool",
    category="test_tool",
    tags={"tag1": "value1", "tag2": "value2"},
)
def my_tool(self, input_text: str) -> str:
    # Replace with your tool code.
    # Usually connection contains configs to connect to an API.
    # Use CustomConnection is a dict. You can use it like: connection.api_key, connection.api_base
    # Not all tools need a connection. You can remove it if you don't need it.
    return "Hello " + input_text
```
