# Customizing an LLM tool
In this document, we will guide you through the process of customizing an LLM tool, allowing users to seamlessly connect to a large language model with prompt tuning experience using a `PromptTemplate`.

## Prerequisites
- Please ensure that your [Prompt flow for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-flow.prompt-flow) is updated to version 1.2.0 or later.

## How to customize an LLM tool
Here we use [an existing tool package](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/tree/main/examples/tools/tool-package-quickstart/my_tool_package) as an example. If you want to create your own tool, please refer to [create and use tool package](create-and-use-tool-package.md).  

Develop the tool code as in [this example](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/blob/main/examples/tools/tool-package-quickstart/my_tool_package/tools/tool_with_custom_llm_type.py).
- Add a `CustomConnection` input to the tool, which is used to authenticate and establish a connection to the large language model.
- Add a `PromptTemplate` input to the tool, which serves as an argument to be passed into the large language model.

    ```python
    from jinja2 import Template
    from promptflow import tool
    from promptflow.connections import CustomConnection
    from promptflow.contracts.types import PromptTemplate


    @tool
    def my_tool(connection: CustomConnection, prompt: PromptTemplate, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Customize your own code to use the connection and prompt here.
        rendered_prompt = Template(prompt, trim_blocks=True, keep_trailing_newline=True).render(**kwargs)
        return rendered_prompt
    ```

## Use the tool in VS Code
Follow the steps to [build and install your tool package](create-and-use-tool-package.md#build-and-share-the-tool-package) and [use your tool from VS Code extension](create-and-use-tool-package.md#use-your-tool-from-vscode-extension).  

Here we use an existing flow to demonstrate the experience, open [this flow](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow/blob/main/examples/tools/use-cases/custom_llm_tool_showcase/flow.dag.yaml) in VS Code extension.  
- There is a node named "my_custom_llm_tool" with a prompt template file. You can either use an existing file or create a new one as the prompt template file.
