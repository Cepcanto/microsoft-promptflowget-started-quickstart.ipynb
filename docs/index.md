# Prompt flow

[**Prompt flow**](https://github.com/microsoft/promptflow) is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As the momentum for LLM-based AI applications continues to grow across the globe, prompt flow provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies the process of prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and deploying your AI applications. 

With prompt flow, you will be able to: 

- Create executable flows that link LLMs, prompts, and Python tools through a visualized graph. 
- Debug, share, and iterate your flows with ease through team collaboration. 
- Create prompt variants and evaluate their performance through large-scale testing. 
- Deploy a real-time endpoint that unlocks the full power of LLMs for your application. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NOTE**: This project is just like AI and will evolve quickly.
