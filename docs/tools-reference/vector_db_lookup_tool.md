# Vector DB Lookup

Vector DB Lookup is a vector search tool that allows users to search top k similiar vectors from vector database. This tool is a wrapper for multiple third-party vector databases. The list of current supported databases is as follows.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Cognitive Search | Microsoft's cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities that enrich all types of information to help identify and explore relevant content at scale. |

This tool will add support for more vector databases, including Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus etc.

## Requirements
- embeddingstore --extra-index-url https://azuremlsdktestpypi.azureedge.net/embeddingstore


## Prerequisites

The tool searches data from a third-party vector database. To use it, you should create resources in advance and establish connections between the tool and the resource.

  - **Azure Cognitive Search:**
    - Create resource [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal).
    - Add "Cognitive search" connection. Fill "API key" field with "Primary admin key" from "Keys" section of created resource, and fill "API base" field with the URL, the URL format is `https://{your_serive_name}.search.windows.net`.

## Inputs

The following are available input parameters:
- **Azure Cognitive Search:**

  | Name | Type | Description | Required |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
  | connection | CognitiveSearchConnection | The created workspace connection for accessing to Cognitive Search endpoint. | Yes |
  | index_name | string | The index name created in Cognitive Search resource. | Yes |
  | text_field | string | The text field name. The returned text filed will populate the result of text. | No |
  | vector_field | string | The vector field name. The target vector is searched in this vector field. | Yes |
  | search_params | dict | The search parameters. It's key-value pairs. Except for parameters in the tool input list mentioned above, additional search parameters can be formed into a JSON object as search_params. For example, use `{"select": ""}` as search_params to select the returned fields, use `{"search": ""}` to perform a [hybrid search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-vector#hybrid-search).| No |
  | search_filters | dict | The search filters. It's key-value pairs, the input format is like `{"filter": ""}` | No |
  | vector | list | The target vector to be queried, which can be generated by Embedding tool. | Yes |
  | top_k | int | The count of top-scored entities to return. Default value is 3 | No |


## Outputs

The following is an example JSON format response returned by the tool, which includes the top-k scored entities. The entity follows a generic schema of vector search result provided by EmbeddingStore SDK. 
- **Azure Cognitive Search:**

  For Azure Cognitive Search, the following fields are populated:
  | Field Name | Type | Description |
  | ---- | ---- | ----------- |
  | original_entity | dict | the original response json from search REST API|
  | score | float |  the score from the original entity, which determines the rank of search results|
  | text | string | text of the entity, the text field name is specified in input|
  | vector | list | vector of the entity, the vector field name is specified in input|
