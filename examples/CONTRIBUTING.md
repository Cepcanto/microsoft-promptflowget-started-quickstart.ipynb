# Contributing to Examples Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the examples project. This project contains a collection of Python notebooks and selected markdown files that demonstrate various workflows using the readme.py script. The script will automatically generate a README.md file in the root folder, listing all the notebooks and markdown files with their corresponding workflows.

## How to Contribute

Before you start working on your contribution, please make sure you have read and followed the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and the [License](../LICENSE) of this project.

To contribute to this project, you can either:

- Submit an issue on GitHub if you have any suggestions, questions, or bug reports.
- Fork the repository and create a pull request if you want to add a new notebook or markdown file, or modify an existing one.

## Guidelines for Notebooks and Markdown Files

When creating or modifying a notebook or markdown file, please follow these guidelines:

- Each notebook or markdown file should have a clear and descriptive title as the first line, using the `#` markdown syntax.
- Each notebook or markdown file should have a brief introduction that explains the purpose and scope of the example, using the `##` markdown syntax.
- Each notebook file should have a metadata area at the top. The metadata area should contain the following fields:
    - `.metadata.description`: A short description of the example that will be displayed in the README.md file. The description should be concise and informative, and end with a period.
    - `.metadata.no_readme_generation`: A boolean value that indicates whether the script should skip generating a workflow for this notebook or markdown file. If set to `true`, the script will ignore this file. If set to `false` or omitted, the script will generate a workflow for this file.
- Each notebook or markdown file should have a clear and logical structure, using appropriate headings, subheadings, comments, and code cells. The code cells should be executable and produce meaningful outputs.
- Each notebook or markdown file should follow the [PEP 8] style guide for Python code, and use consistent and readable variable names, indentation, spacing, and punctuation.
- Each notebook or markdown file should include relevant references, citations, and acknowledgements, using the `##` markdown syntax and the `[description](url)` format for links.

## How to Run the Script

To run the readme.py script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

Then, you can run the script by:

```bash
python readme.py
```

The script will scan all the notebooks and markdown files in the examples folder, and generate a README.md file in the root folder. The README.md file will contain a table of contents with links to each notebook and markdown file, as well as their descriptions and workflows.

The workflows are generated by extracting the code cells from each notebook or markdown file, and converting them to bash commands. For notebooks, only code cells that do not have `.metadata.no_readme_generation` set to `true` will be included. For markdown files, only code cells that use the `bash` syntax will be included.

The script will also create a workflows folder in the root folder, where each notebook or markdown file will have a corresponding workflow file with the `.sh` extension. The workflow files can be executed by running:

```bash
bash workflows/<filename>.sh
```

where `<filename>` is the name of the notebook or markdown file without the extension.
