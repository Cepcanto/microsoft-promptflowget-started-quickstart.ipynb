{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the main difference between BERT and previous language representation models?", "answer": "BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.", "context": "Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers."}
{"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf", "chat_history":[], "question": "What is the advantage of fine-tuning BERT over using feature-based approaches?", "answer": "Fine-tuning BERT reduces the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures and transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.", "context": "We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures."}
