We find strong evidence in support of this hypothesis across three different experiments, each of which reveal different facets of moral self-correction. We find that the capability for moral self-correction emerges at 22B model parameters, and typically improves with increasing model size and RLHF training. We believe that at this level of scale, language models obtain two capabilities that they can use for moral self-correction: (1) they can follow instructions and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts of harm like stereotyping, bias, and discrimination. As such, they can follow instructions to avoid certain kinds of morally harmful outputs.

The tools include Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that provides developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly, and Amazon Elastic Inference, which allows developers to add GPU acceleration to any Amazon EC2 instance for faster inference. Additionally, AWS has launched a new generative AI service called Amazon SageMaker Autopilot, which automatically trains and tunes machine learning models for developers. These new tools aim to make it easier for developers to build and deploy generative AI models on AWS..\nOUTPUT:"}], "temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1, "stream": false, "stop": null, "max_tokens": 128, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "logit_bias": {}, "user": "", "response_format": null}, "output": {"id": "chatcmpl-8pWKCJMcA8JZe1WKVWV4YhFmz4m6o", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Text content\"}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1707289676, "model": "gpt-35-turbo", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 15, "prompt_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 721}}, "start_time": 1707289676.257379, "end_time": 1707289676.883544, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": null, "parent_id": "cae646c7-9b9b-4365-8f7c-f95bdc5ce4de", "id": "31487dd2-d18d-42df-9d11-5bc69e533be5", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 15, "prompt_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 721}}], "node_name": "classify_with_llm", "parent_id": "", "id": "cae646c7-9b9b-4365-8f7c-f95bdc5ce4de", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 15, "prompt_tokens": 706, "total_tokens": 721}}, {"name": "convert_to_dict", "type": "Tool", "inputs": {"input_str": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Text content\"}"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Text content"}, "start_time": 1707289676.899561, "end_time": 1707289676.899849, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": "convert_to_dict", "parent_id": "", "id": "7789774a-9e3c-4d14-84ed-df84c3fdde72", "system_metrics": {}}], "system_metrics": {"duration": 2.951248, "prompt_tokens": 1192, "completion_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 1333}, "inputs": {"url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/announcing-new-tools-for-building-with-generative-ai-on-aws/", "line_number": 0}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Text content"}, "error": null}], "variant_id": "", "name": "", "description": "", "tags": null, "system_metrics": {"duration": 2.951248, "prompt_tokens": 1192, "completion_tokens": 141, "total_tokens": 1333}, "result": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Text content"}, "upload_metrics": false}, "start_time": "2024-02-07T07:07:53.956433", "end_time": "2024-02-07T07:07:56.907681", "name": "", "description": "", "status": "Completed", "tags": null}

See our ethics statement.Snapchat Lenses inside Microsoft Teams Image: MicrosoftMicrosoft has teamed up with Snap to add Snapchat Lenses to Microsoft Teams. More than 20 Snapchat Lenses are now part of the Microsoft Teams app, including ones that will place a cat on your head, a sloth on your shoulder, or virtual sunglasses on your face during video calls.Teams users don\u2019t need to download a separate app or add-on, as Microsoft has integrated Snapchat\u2019s AR Lenses directly into the video effects section of the Teams client. Microsoft has leveraged Snap\u2019s Camera Kit SDK to bring these Snapchat Lenses to Teams.While Microsoft also uses Snap\u2019s Camera Kit for its Flip education platform to add Snapchat Lenses to videos, this new Teams feature will be limited to Teams for Work users only. If you\u2019re using the personal or education version of Teams you won\u2019t be able to get access to these new Snapchat Lenses. You\u2019ll also have to use the current \u201cclassic\u201d version of Teams instead of the \u201cNew Teams\u201d preview client that Microsoft started previewing late last month.Microsoft has used Snap\u2019s Camera Kit to integrate Snapchat Lenses into Teams.
