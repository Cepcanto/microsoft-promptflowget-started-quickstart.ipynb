Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information.

Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information. For the multi-granularity capability, we propose a multi-choice learning scheme during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels that correspond to multiple ground-truth masks. Notably, this work represents the first attempt to jointly train a model on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that our model successfully achieves semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. Furthermore, co\nSummary:"}], "temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1, "stream": false, "stop": null, "max_tokens": 128, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "logit_bias": {}, "user": "", "response_format": null, "seed": null}, "output": {"id": "chatcmpl-92CzKHqqpoxVzJSjzaGLuOF5pIN85", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "length", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "The paper introduces Semantic-SAM, a universal image segmentation model that can segment and recognize anything at any desired granularity.
