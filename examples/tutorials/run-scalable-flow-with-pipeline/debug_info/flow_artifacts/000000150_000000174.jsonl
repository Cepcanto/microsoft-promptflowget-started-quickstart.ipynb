Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information. For the multi-granularity capability, we propose a multi-choice learning scheme during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels that correspond to multiple ground-truth masks. Notably, this work represents the first attempt to jointly train a model on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that our model successfully achieves semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance.

Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information.

The model has two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, the model consolidates multiple datasets and introduces decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows the model to capture rich semantic information. For multi-granularity capability, a multi-choice learning scheme is proposed during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels. The model is trained on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate the success of the model in achieving.\nOUTPUT:"}], "temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1, "stream": false, "stop": null, "max_tokens": 128, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "logit_bias": {}, "user": "", "response_format": null, "seed": null}, "output": {"id": "chatcmpl-92D0ATzkMC7zstkaGA0x2CjAFmQGD", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1710313662, "model": "gpt-35-turbo", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "start_time": 1710313662.120718, "end_time": 1710313662.414181, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": null, "parent_id": "07caffe7-78a0-40fb-86be-f6f8bd7c9d57", "id": "1db9a555-3293-4670-8bdd-0a96424bc3fe", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}}], "node_name": "classify_with_llm", "parent_id": "", "id": "07caffe7-78a0-40fb-86be-f6f8bd7c9d57", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}}, {"name": "convert_to_dict", "type": "Tool", "inputs": {"input_str": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "start_time": 1710313662.418906, "end_time": 1710313662.419458, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": "convert_to_dict", "parent_id": "", "id": "1b7a519a-6792-4b2c-810b-c66250bf9982", "system_metrics": {}}], "system_metrics": {"duration": 3.124627, "prompt_tokens": 1162, "completion_tokens": 142, "total_tokens": 1304}, "inputs": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04767"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "error": null}], "variant_id": "", "name": "", "description": "", "tags": null, "system_metrics": {"duration": 3.124627, "prompt_tokens": 1162, "completion_tokens": 142, "total_tokens": 1304}, "result": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "upload_metrics": false}, "start_time": "2024-03-13T07:07:39.295788", "end_time": "2024-03-13T07:07:42.420415", "name": "", "description": "", "status": "Completed", "tags": null}
