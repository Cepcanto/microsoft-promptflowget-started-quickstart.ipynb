To achieve semantic-awareness, the model consolidates multiple datasets and introduces decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows the model to capture rich semantic information. For multi-granularity capability, the model proposes a multi-choice learning scheme during training, generating masks at multiple levels corresponding to multiple ground-truth masks. The paper demonstrates that the model successfully achieves semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance through experimental results and visualizations..\nOUTPUT:"}], "temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1, "stream": false, "stop": null, "max_tokens": 128, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "logit_bias": {}, "user": "", "response_format": null, "seed": null}, "output": {"id": "chatcmpl-92D0MUHV8TpqWf5WJYqD3TO1loVRK", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1710313674, "model": "gpt-35-turbo", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 690, "total_tokens": 704}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "start_time": 1710313674.930946, "end_time": 1710313675.21937, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": null, "parent_id": "13f1239f-b5a0-4196-81b6-25adfb142190", "id": "53708f60-d5dd-4b73-ad96-d58c00776f94", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 690, "total_tokens": 704}}], "node_name": "classify_with_llm", "parent_id": "", "id": "13f1239f-b5a0-4196-81b6-25adfb142190", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 690, "total_tokens": 704}}, {"name": "convert_to_dict", "type": "Tool", "inputs": {"input_str": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "start_time": 1710313675.223559, "end_time": 1710313675.224075, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": "convert_to_dict", "parent_id": "", "id": "ef18016c-fd2f-4b43-81d1-989b36f5840c", "system_metrics": {}}], "system_metrics": {"duration": 1.924457, "prompt_tokens": 1157, "completion_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 1295}, "inputs": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04767"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "error": null}], "variant_id": "", "name": "", "description": "", "tags": null, "system_metrics": {"duration": 1.924457, "prompt_tokens": 1157, "completion_tokens": 138, "total_tokens": 1295}, "result": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "upload_metrics": false}, "start_time": "2024-03-13T07:07:53.300562", "end_time": "2024-03-13T07:07:55.225019", "name": "", "description": "", "status": "Completed", "tags": null}

The model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, the model consolidates multiple datasets across three granularities and introduces decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows the model to capture rich semantic information. For multi-granularity capability, a multi-choice learning scheme is proposed during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels. The model is trained on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate the success.\nOUTPUT:"}], "temperature": 0.2, "top_p": 1.0, "n": 1, "stream": false, "stop": null, "max_tokens": 128, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "logit_bias": {}, "user": "", "response_format": null, "seed": null}, "output": {"id": "chatcmpl-92D0e6yQVTyRRDesOq896IML6W8YA", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}], "created": 1710313692, "model": "gpt-35-turbo", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}, "start_time": 1710313692.731826, "end_time": 1710313693.053237, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": null, "parent_id": "20ed171c-ba80-47bd-b227-75ab01fabfd3", "id": "c052710c-699b-4644-b028-64cd0a584aef", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}}], "node_name": "classify_with_llm", "parent_id": "", "id": "20ed171c-ba80-47bd-b227-75ab01fabfd3", "system_metrics": {"completion_tokens": 14, "prompt_tokens": 695, "total_tokens": 709}}, {"name": "convert_to_dict", "type": "Tool", "inputs": {"input_str": "{\"category\": \"Academic\", \"evidence\": \"Both\"}"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "start_time": 1710313693.058013, "end_time": 1710313693.058569, "error": null, "children": [], "node_name": "convert_to_dict", "parent_id": "", "id": "685d204f-9bd8-4370-80c4-6c0db48f0ddf", "system_metrics": {}}], "system_metrics": {"duration": 3.118388, "prompt_tokens": 1162, "completion_tokens": 142, "total_tokens": 1304}, "inputs": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04767"}, "output": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "error": null}], "variant_id": "", "name": "", "description": "", "tags": null, "system_metrics": {"duration": 3.118388, "prompt_tokens": 1162, "completion_tokens": 142, "total_tokens": 1304}, "result": {"category": "Academic", "evidence": "Both"}, "upload_metrics": false}, "start_time": "2024-03-13T07:08:09.941267", "end_time": "2024-03-13T07:08:13.059655", "name": "", "description": "", "status": "Completed", "tags": null}

Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information. For the multi-granularity capability, we propose a multi-choice learning scheme during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels that correspond to multiple ground-truth masks. Notably, this work represents the first attempt to jointly train a model on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that our model successfully achieves semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance.
