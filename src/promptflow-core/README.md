## Introduction 

The `promptflow-core` package provides the essential features needed to execute a `flow` in prompt flow.

For those seeking a **minimal** dependency to execute a flow in serving or cloud run scenarios, installing this package alone will suffice.

However, if you require the full capabilities of the `devkit` to simplify the usage of flow, connection, and run in local devlopment lifecycle, please install the complete package using `pip install promptflow`.
