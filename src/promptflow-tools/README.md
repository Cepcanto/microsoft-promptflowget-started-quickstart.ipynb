## Introduction

Tools are the fundamental building blocks of a flow in Azure Machine Learning Prompt flow. Each tool is a simple, executable unit with a specific function, allowing users to perform various tasks. By combining different tools, users can create a flow that accomplishes a wide range of goals. One of the key benefit of prompt flow tools is their seamless integration with third-party APIs and python open source packages. This not only improves the functionality of large language models but also makes the development process more efficient for developers.

In this package, we provide a set of builtin tools of prompt flow, which are the most commonly used tools in the development of AI applications. We also support users to create their own tools and share them with others. See [Custom tool package creation and usage](https://github.com/Azure/promptflow/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/how-to-create-and-use-your-own-tool-package.md) for more details.
